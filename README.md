## Project Overview

  Designed an 8 bit Microcontroller using basic components like Instruction Counter, Program Counter, RAM 256x8, Decoder, PLA ROM, Stack Pointer
  
  Instruction Set: 
  JUMP
  READ From RAM to R0
  READ From RAM to R1
  Write to arbitrary address in RAM from R2 (Basic Interrupt)
  ADD R0,R1
  AND R0,R1
  COPY R0,R2
  COPY R1,R2
  
  
  
  Simulated using Logisim and verified with developed Machine Language according to Instruction Set
